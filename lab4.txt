Lab 4 adds to Lab 3. 
**Everything is the same; the only change is using structs this time.
Requirements:
Type: struct
– char string for the animal name
– int array (size 2) for the time and minutes

Global variables:
– 1 struct array with 10 entries
– counter
  • The counter shows the number of animals in the array

Use a pointer to traverse the array in the following
function
– showall
You may use pointers in more functions
