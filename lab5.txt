Lab 5 adds to Lab 4.
Instructions:
Add Feeding Time:
– Use a union to add extra info to each entry
– Info about the feeding depends on a flag
	• location == 0 -- cage coordinates
	• location == 1 -- place, such as birdcage
Requirements:
Functions/Commands remain the same, except for 1:
– 1 <animal> <hour> <minutes><0 or 1><cage coordinates or place>
	• Same as lab 4, but add extra info

**Functions insert and showall need to change to include the union
**Function change may need to change depending on how you are dealing with the members
