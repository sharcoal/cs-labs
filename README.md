# cs-labs

This repository includes labs in C from the course Advanced Programming taken at my university. Each lab will include codes, instructions, and there is one makefile that will serve to compile any lab included.

Labs 1-6 do not use multiple files; therefore they will be in the main section. To see labs 7-9, click into their respective folders.
