# cs-labs

This repository includes labs in C from the course Advanced Programming taken at my university. Each lab will include codes, instructions, and there is one makefile that will serve to compile any lab included.

Labs 1-6 do not use multiple files. To see their content, simply click into the file named "labX.c".
The makefile can be used for all of the labs.
Labs 7-9 use multiple files. To see their content, open every file with the number in the name (ex: lab7.c, main7.c, list7.c, etc.)
